The paper, titled **"Theoretical model and structural performance of assembled joint between circular CFDST column and composite beam"** by Guo et al. (2020), explores the design, theoretical modeling, and finite element (FE) analysis of joints between circular concrete-filled double-skin steel tubular (CFDST) columns and composite beams connected with blind bolts. Key highlights from the paper that are relevant for your work include:

1. **Objective**: The paper presents a sophisticated theoretical model to evaluate the stiffness and moment capacity of a joint between circular CFDST columns and composite beams. It incorporates the bending stiffness of a curved end plate connected with blind bolts, emphasizing that the curvature and connection setup significantly influence structural performance.

2. **Finite Element Model (FE Model)**: The authors created an FE model in Abaqus, validating it against experimental results. They used this model to perform parametric analyses on factors affecting joint behavior, such as the steel beam strength, column hollow ratio, concrete strength, bolt diameter, and spacing.

3. **Validation**: The FE model replicates various experimental findings accurately, especially in terms of failure modes, stiffness, and hysteresis curves, providing a strong foundation for future studies.

4. **Significance for Your Thesis**: Replicating this FE model in Abaqus will validate the approach and ensure that it aligns with established methodologies. It will also serve as a strong comparative basis when you analyze a similar configuration but with square HSRC columns.
